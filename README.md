# TriviaGame

Week 5 Homework.

In this assignment we’ve created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and JQuery to manipulate HTML.

We’ve created a Trivia game that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or time runs out. There are 10 questions in total and 15 seconds of given time per question for answer.
If the player selects the corre3ct answer, there will be the screen with congratulations and after a few seconds the next question will be displayed without user input. And it’s similar for wrong answers and time-outs:
-	If the player runs out of time, the player will be informed about it and will be shown the correct answer. After a few seconds the next question will be displayed without user input.
-	If the player chooses the wrong answer, he will be informed that was the wrong choice and the correct answer will be shown along with the picture related to the correct answer. After a few seconds the next question will be displayed without user input.

On the final screen will be displayed the number of correct and wrong answers and the number of unanswered questions if there are any.  And although will display  an option to play again (without reloading the page).
